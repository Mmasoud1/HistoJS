### Pull Requests


Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Fork HistoJS repository to have a copy on your github.
2. Push your updates to the forked HistoJS repository on your github.
3. Into your forked HistoJS repository create a pull request, it should show you the base repository (original one)  and the head repository (forked one), choose master branch for each and create pull request
4. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

5. Don't delete your forked repository until your pull request approved and merged.
