## Issues Guidelines

Before create issue:
- check for existing issues.
- create **pen** on [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) with your problem.
- describe the problem in detail (use issue template).

## Pull Request Guidelines
**Before create the pull request, you must sign the [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](CLA.txt).**

The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

To create pull request:
- Each pull request should close `one problem`.
- Check that you are using the latest version of the library.
- Create pull request to the `latest develop branch` (a greatest number).
- The patch must contains files in `source` folder only.
- Add patch keyword to your pull request title: `fix bug`, `update feature`, `add feature`.
- If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title.
